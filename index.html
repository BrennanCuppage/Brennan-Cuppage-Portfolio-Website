                Small Wonder- Survival VR Game

                    Small Wonder is a VR experience game that I hold very near to my heart.
                    I wanted to create something that could take advantage of the VR platform to really create a powerful experience. 
                    Inspired by games like Little Nightmares and other media from companies like Studio Ghibli, I settled on the idea of Small Wonder. 
                    At the outset of the game, you have been shrunk to only a few inches tall in size. 
                    Struggling to find your way back to normalcy, you're forced to use household clutter in new and interesting ways to progress from room to room, 
                    avoiding threats that you can no longer just brush aside like any ordinary common pest. 
                    This project was incredibly enlightening for me, because it showed me everything that went into a game. 
                    My project is still a demo, but covering all the gameplay, all the assets, the textures, the audio, the UX testing and the VR implementation was a massive hill to climb. 
                    It was so rewarding to get done, though. Seeing my hard work all come together and having full creative control over my work was just amazing.
                    This was my first step into VR, and I know that with the blooming of my skills, Small Wonder will become every bit as immersive and awe-inspiring as I want it to be.

            <p>
                What can I say? I'm a sucker for the classics. As Above, So Below is still in development, but is a project 
                I fully intend to take through to its completion- A 2d MetroidVania game that I had a ton of fun building in my 
                first year of game development, and continue to have a great time working on to this day. Become those you kill 
                and navigate the caves sprawling beneath the earth. Can you find your kidnapped sister? Or will you lose yourself? 
                This program taught me a lot about the basics of Unity in 2d, as well as map creation and level design, and has only taught 
                me more complex mechanics as I build it higher. It was also my introduction to sprite design and tilemaps.

                3D Models- Dragonfly
            </h3>
            <div class = "row">

            <p class = "col">
                Part of my development of Small Wonder, the fitting antagonists of the game would be rats, roaches, spiders and flies, so when I sat down to challenge myself, I decided to sprite one of them.
                What I decided on was this. Modeled off of a Blue Dasher dragonfly, this is one of the most complicated rigged models I've built so far. 
                Between six spindly legs and two independent sets of gossamer wings, there were a lot of challenges behind the model, but I'm very happy with it. 
                Inverse Kinematics handles in each leg and its tail, paired with controllers for the wings and tilt of the head, allow it a wide range of mobility. 
                This really pushed my limits at the time of its creation in the realm of weight painting, modeling, rigging and animating hard surfaces- the plates that make up the bug's exoskeleton.
