                What we create outlives us, and empowers us to empower others. That's what I aim to do. I'm Brennan Cuppage, up and coming 2D/3D artist, animator and game designer. 
                If you're reading this, you're either one of my professors (hello, Jack!) or you've come here to see what I'm capable of. Have a look around! All of the work I feel proudest of is here for you, 
                along with my personal experience with art and coding mediums and programs. Stay a while, and enjoy!

                Small Wonder- Survival VR Game
            </h3>
            <h4>
                Small Wonder is a VR experience game that I hold very near to my heart.
                I wanted to create something that could take advantage of the VR platform to really create a powerful experience. 
                Inspired by games like Little Nightmares and other media from companies like Studio Ghibli, I settled on the idea of Small Wonder. 
                At the outset of the game, you have been shrunk to only a few inches tall in size. 
                Struggling to find your way back to normalcy, you're forced to use household clutter in new and interesting ways to progress from room to room, 
                avoiding threats that you can no longer just brush aside like any ordinary common pest. 
                This project was incredibly enlightening for me, because it showed me everything that went into a game. 
                My project is still a demo, but covering all the gameplay, all the assets, the textures, the audio, the UX testing and the VR implementation was a massive hill to climb. 
                It was so rewarding to get done, though. Seeing my hard work all come together and having full creative control over my work was just amazing.
                This was my first step into VR, and I know that with the blooming of my skills, Small Wonder will become every bit as immersive and awe-inspiring as I want it to be.
