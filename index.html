                Small Wonder- Survival VR Game

                    Small Wonder is a VR experience game that I hold very near to my heart.
                    I wanted to create something that could take advantage of the VR platform to really create a powerful experience. 
                    Inspired by games like Little Nightmares and other media from companies like Studio Ghibli, I settled on the idea of Small Wonder. 
                    At the outset of the game, you have been shrunk to only a few inches tall in size. 
                    Struggling to find your way back to normalcy, you're forced to use household clutter in new and interesting ways to progress from room to room, 
                    avoiding threats that you can no longer just brush aside like any ordinary common pest. 
                    This project was incredibly enlightening for me, because it showed me everything that went into a game. 
                    My project is still a demo, but covering all the gameplay, all the assets, the textures, the audio, the UX testing and the VR implementation was a massive hill to climb. 
                    It was so rewarding to get done, though. Seeing my hard work all come together and having full creative control over my work was just amazing.
                    This was my first step into VR, and I know that with the blooming of my skills, Small Wonder will become every bit as immersive and awe-inspiring as I want it to be.

                What can I say? I'm a sucker for the classics. This unnamed Roguelite is still in development, but is a project 
                I fully intend to take through to its completion- A 2d game inspired by other Roguelites like Enter the Gungeon and 
                The Binding of Isaac. I developed this game on my own time during my final semester in college, and built the assets 
                from scratch as well as doing all the coding for myself. An apprentice magician is sent to cleanse a set of ruins from 
                a monstrous host, but can't help but feel an attunement with many of the powerful artifacts found within. Choose your spells 
                and your path carefully. It's easy to get lost down here... body and mind.

                3D Model- Dragonfly

                Part of my development of Small Wonder, the fitting antagonists of the game would be rats, roaches, spiders and flies, so when I sat down to challenge myself, I decided to sprite one of them.
                What I decided on was this. Modeled off of a Blue Dasher dragonfly, this is one of the most complicated rigged models I've built so far. 
                Between six spindly legs and two independent sets of gossamer wings, there were a lot of challenges behind the model, but I'm very happy with it. 
                Inverse Kinematics handles in each leg and its tail, paired with controllers for the wings and tilt of the head, allow it a wide range of mobility. 
                This really pushed my limits at the time of its creation in the realm of weight painting, modeling, rigging and animating the hard surfaces of the plates that make up the bug's exoskeleton.
