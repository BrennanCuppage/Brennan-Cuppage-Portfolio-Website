    <p>
        Well, if you've made it this far you either like what you saw on my homepage, you came here to get a sense about me first, or you're hopelessly lost. 
        Whatever the case may be, welcome! I hope you enjoy your stay. 
        It's a pleasure to meet you.

        My name is Brennan Patrick Tyler Cuppage, and I'm an aspiring game developer, animator, and 3D modeller. 
        This website, as time moves forward, should be a consistently growing list of my projects and accomplishments, to document where I've been, what I can do, and how much I've grown. 
        Ever since I was young, I've loved diving into new and creative worlds, be that through video games or books or movies. As I grew up, I knew I wanted to start creating worlds of my own. 
        Game development and 3D art allow me to do that, helping to bring life and shape to what I have in my brain and get it out into bytes and into the world.
