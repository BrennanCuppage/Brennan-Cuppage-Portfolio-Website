        Well, if you've made it this far you either like what you saw on my homepage, you came here to get a sense about me first, or you're hopelessly lost. 
        Whatever the case may be, welcome! I hope you enjoy your stay. 
        It's a pleasure to meet you. 
        <br>

        My name is Brennan Cuppage, and I'm an aspiring game developer, animator, and 3D modeller. 
        This website, as time moves forward, should be a consistently growing list of my projects and accomplishments, to document where I've been, what I can do, and how much I've grown. 
        Ever since I was young, I've loved diving into new and creative worlds, be that through video games or books or movies. As I grew up, I knew I wanted to start creating worlds of my own. 
        Game development and 3D art allow me to do that, helping to bring life and shape to what I have in my brain and get it out into bytes and into the world. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I've been in this field for about four years now, learning as much as I can as quickly as I can get my hands on it. I've developed for computers, Apple devices and VR headsets, 
        and I'm versed in modelling in both Autodesk Maya and Blender. I have a few long-running projects that I'm always working on as time presents itself, and I'm constantly 
        striving to grow and improve as a creator, a storyteller and a designer. Even in my free time, I love to create and explore new worlds- improving my 2D art skills, writing stories or diving into the newest game in my collection. In those 
        snippets of time that are free without being long enough to dive head-first into coding software, at least.
